    <h1>First python exercises</h1>
    <p>The extensions Python Intellisence, Python for VSCode and Python Indent have allowed VSCode Intellisence to continue working !</p>
    
    <h4 id='big'>Basics</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Three ways to print a string statement.</li>
        <li>Debugging</li>
        <li>Create multi-line strings</li>
        <li>String operations</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Python functions</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Advantages of using functions</li>
    <li>Built-in Python functions EG. print()</li>
    <li>Creating a Python function
        def say_hi():
        ...     print('Hi')
        ...
        say_hi() 
        Hi
    </li>
    <li>Indentation</li>
    <li>Python function parameters and arguments</li>
    <li>Variable scope</li>
    <p>See Variable scope in py file - say_hi was able to use the variable name, as expected, because it’s a top-level variable 
        that is visible everywhere. However, answer, defined inside say_hi, is not known outside of the function and causes 
        a NameError. Python gives us an informative and detailed error: “name ‘answer’ is not defined.”</p>
    <li>Python function with multiple arguments</li>
    <li>Default values and named parameters</li>
    <p>See Default values in py file - Because our parameters have a default value, you don’t have to fill them in. If you don’t, 
        the default is used. If you do, you override the default with your own value. Parameters declared in reletive positions 
        can be used too.</p>
    </ul>

    <h4>Booleans and comparison operators</h4>
    <p>See simple example in py file</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Operators</li>
        <li>>	greater than</li>
        <li><	smaller than</li>
        <li>>=	greater than or equal to</li>
        <li><=	smaller than or equal to</li>
        <li>==	is equal</li>
        <li>!=	is not equal</li>
        <li>NB - === is equal type is not used!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To avoid confusion and typeErrors best not to compare integers to strings</p>

    <h4>Python For-loop</h4>
    <p>Iterable. An iterable is an object in Python that can return its members one at a time.</p>

    <h4>Python for-loops and lists</h4>
    <p>Lists also happen to be iterable; hence they work very well with a for-loop</p>
    <p>A list can be created with block quotes. Its contents are objects of whatever type you like, 
        separated by commas, and they don’t need to be of the same type. A list can contain all the 
        types we’ve seen so far: numbers, strings, booleans, and even other lists. Indeed, you can 
        create a list of lists. We can access the individual elements of a list manually too</p>

    <h4>Python While-loop</h4>
    <p>See example in py file</p>
    <p>press control+ c to escape infinite loops!</p>
   <h4>Later see "Python list comprehensions". What are they?</h4>

   <h4>First Python Program</h4>
   <p>See example in py file</p>

   <h4>Python Comment: What It Is And How to Create</h4>
   <p>Use self-documenting code to reduce comments to a minimum</p>
   <h4>Docstrings: document your code with strings</h4>
   <p>Docstring
    A docstring is a string that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition. 
    Such a docstring becomes the __doc__ special attribute of that object.</p>
