"Revised string operations"
"Complete functions built in and constructed"
"Change font size p to 1.5em Complete execises on basic functions"
"Complete Booleans and comparison operators"
"Start Python For Loop and While Loop exercises - and completed"
"Revised for-loops Create First Python Program!"
"Revised first program Create comments Read docstrings"
"Will look at docstrings again as tutorial progresses Part-tutorial Classes and Objects in Python"
"Continue with What are classes and objects in Python? Creating classes and objects in Python What Is self in Python? Creating Multiple Objects Not finished!"
"Completed Multiple Objects Completed to Python Constructors"
"Revised simple functions to get used to indentation Will have to do it again!"
"Have looked at various python tutorials and will stick with pythonland but will save any interesting, relevant, understandable youtubes etc. Getting familiar with indents Am working through Intro knowledge about Strings Numbers Booleans Dictionaries Variables Loops Iterators and much more!"
"Pythonland tutorials were not so easy to follow so am trying learnpython dev with NNJA Clear layout is easier to follow Will update project files with this info"
"Complete Day 1. Intro to Python 1. Why Choose Python About Python, Conventions, Anatomy of a Python Program, 2. Basic Data Types, Variables and Types, Numbers, Strings and enjoyable so far!"
"Completed defining functions"
"Re-do function arguements, defaults, keywords and order of declaration!"
"Moving on to function scope"
"Complete functions up to Practise"
"Practise exercise for function scope is V clever! Complete advanced data types - Lists: Indexes and Indices, Updating,  Range, Formatting (actually this means layout including a trailing comma) Sorting a Copy Of Your List / and In Place, Finding methods" 
"Work on lists 2 up to,  Looking for Items, Adding items, getting help, adding a list to a list"
"Looking for Items - True / False above but also...  with error or with count Updating Items"
"Have transferred to Python for Everybody tutorial video by CodeCamp Have reached 1hr 15mins"
"Remove content erster, zweiter and dritte files and re-use for python programs from Code-camp Python for Everybody"
"Completed Type, Reserved Words, Variables, Operators, Operator precedence, Integer division, Conversion between types, User input, Comments"
"Complete conditional execution practise in erster file up to Multiway with elif(s)"
"Complete Multiway puzzle No 1 and No 2 (will they print?) Start the try / except Structure"
"Complete Start / try structures including user input. Summary so far - Comparison operators, Indentation, One-way decisions, Two-way decisions, Nested decisions, Multiway decisions (elif), Try /except to eliminate errors"
"Start Ch 4 loops and iterations still in ersterP, first simple function and re-use"
"Complete simple function and re-use, built in functions max and min, type conversion int and float, string." 
"Complete Self-build functions, Arguement / Parameter (s). Return values, Return + fruitful, Arguements, Parameters and Results using max function "
"Complete Multiple arguements See function summary in index"
"Ch 5 Loops and iterations up to Indefinite loops that are not so easy to see / control! 2:2240"
"First look at Definite loops and those with strings  - patterns for Smart Loops - picking the highest number - INDENTATION!!"
"Move to file zweiterP for More Loop Patterns Counting in a Loop, Summing in a loop, Finding the average"
"Complete Filtering loops with an if statement, Search in loops with a Boolean statement, Introduce the use of None and is - INDENTATION!!"
"Iteration summary - While loops (indefinite), For loops (Definite), Infinite loops, Iteration variables, Using break, Loop idioms, Using continue, Largest or smallest, None constants and variables"
"Ch 6 Strings, Looking inside strings - Looping, More about in and in is great! More things with strings - Slicing, plus variations on what can be ommitted [:2] etc, normal string concatanation does not create spaces, you have to add + quottn marks +s, in can be used as a logical operator which can be used in an if statement, String comparison - clever illustration"
"Completet exercises String library method calls create a new string, original remains unchanged, Searching a string for a substring, Search and Replace - super useful! as in a wordprocessor, Stripping White space, Prefixes - startswith Boolean "
"OK with Parsing and extracting NB in python3 all strings are Unicode ie understands non latin characters - ok!"
"Strings summary - String type, String Operations, Read convert, String library, Indexing strings, String comparisons, Slicing strings, Searching in strings, Looping through strings with while and for, Stripping white space, Concatanating strings with + and [] "
"Move onto dritteP for Ch 7 Reading files and then using previous chapter techniques, opening files, fhandle, newline character, File processing, fhandle as a sequence"
"Complete line count, startswith, length, Searching through a file with if in the for loop and stripping out blank lines"
"2nd way - Skipping lines with continue 3rd way - using in to select lines, prompt file name as input - Files Summary - Secondary storage, Searching for files, Opening files fhand, Reading file names, File structure \n, Dealing with BAD FILES, Reading files line by line with a loop"
"Ch8  Lists (Data) - Programming Algorithms V Data Structures, Lists and definite loops, Looking inside lists, Lists are mutable, strings are not - watch out! How long is a list? how many elements? - String list or object list"
